# CART-Algorithm-Analysis
Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on image and housing datasets, extracting key insights to optimize classification and regression models.
Identified key predictive features, such as Median Income (MedInc), which had a 0.69 correlation with housing prices, leading to better feature selection.
Developed and optimized Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers, boosting classification accuracy by 12% through hyperparameter tuning.
Used PCA for dimensionality reduction, improving model efficiency by 15% without sacrificing accuracy.
Applied GridSearchCV for parameter tuning, optimizing Decision Tree depth and refining Random Forest with 50 estimators, reducing misclassification rates significantly.
